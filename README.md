# CS 3600 Project 1 - Euclidean Algorithm

My implementation for Project 1 for *CS 3600 Computer Security*. 

The script contains two functions, `euclideanGCD` and 
`extendedEuclidean`, which calculate the greatest common denominator
and the linear combination of their arguments, respectively.


## Installation

Only depends on Python standard libraries.
Compatible with Python 2 and 3.

If on a \*nix machine, you may need to make the script executable
by running `chmod +x euclidean.py`.


## Usage

    ./euclidean.py [a b]

There are two interfaces to `euclidean.py` when executed in a shell.

The first is passing two integer arguments, e.g. `./euclidean.py 9 12`.

The second is the interactive mode outlined in *ยง2 Expected Outcomes*
of the project guidelines accessible by passing no arguments.
